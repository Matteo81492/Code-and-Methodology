To develop the 32 bit dual-core MIPS processor in the Nexys4 DDR board environment I will follow this schedule:

- Single cycle MIPS processor containing all the basic elements.
- Pipeline the single cycle processor into multiple stages.
- Simulation of basic functionalities.
- Development of a Two-way superscalar MIPS processor.
- Simulation and comparison between the superscalar and the pipelined processor.
- Complete core development including caches.
- Testing the core with simple C programs.
- Addition of another core based on the same superscalar design.
- Implementing the coherency protocol and mechanism.
- Adapting the design to better suite the board environment.
- Record results using the VGA display.

Any challenges and exceptions will be mentioned in the logbooks.
