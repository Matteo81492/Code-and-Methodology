The logbook will be updated after every session, and the final document will be duplicated on paper during the last weeks.

22/01/2021 Project Meeting and work ahead:
In this meeting we discussed about the Interim Report and its assessment. We also highlighted the targets for the upcoming weeks and how the work was going to be shared. 

24/01/2021 Repository creation:
During this session I have developed the main repository which will contain all the code and methodology aspects of the project. I have populated the 'main' section with
the key documents and extra files will be added during the semester. I have also design a rough copy of the 32-bit cycle MIPS processor in Vivado and plan on perfectioning 
it in the days ahead.
