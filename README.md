# Code-and-Methodology
This repository highlights the workflow and methodology of the project, and it also contains the SystemVerilog and C++ code. 
Changes will be made throughout the semester on a daily basis using the input coming from the supervisor and the simulation results.
In order to keep the design tidy, I organised the repository in various subsections each, in the final design they are going to be connected to form the final multicore processor.
